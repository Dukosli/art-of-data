1. Discuss how you used the API to obtain the dataset.

##Analysis Results

Now for the analysis of the socks in Animal Crossing. Using the program using the Animal Crossing API, I found that the following socks had the most variations of color. The highest count of variations was eight socks, and the following socks had that many variations:


argyle crew socks<br>
color-blocked socks<br>
frilly knee-high socks<br>
holey tights<br>
kiddie socks<br>
mixed-tweed socks<br>
no-show socks<br>
semi-opaque socks<br>
semi-opaque tights<br>
sequin leggings<br>
simple-accent socks<br>
striped socks<br>
striped tights<br>
tube socks<br>
ultra no-show socks<br>
vivid leggings<br>
vivid socks<br>
vivid tights<be>


For a similar analysis of the variations, my program also counted how many different colors and how many of them existed in all the socks. Since every sock had two colors, the socks with the same first and second colors only had that color counted once. Here are the numbers of each color:


Pink: 44<br>
Red: 43<br>
Aqua: 33<br>
Orange: 28<br>
Purple: 39<br>
Green: 51<br>
Blue: 48<br>
Yellow: 34<br>
White: 89<br>
Black: 65<br>
Beige: 16<br>
Gray: 33<br>
Brown: 11<br>
Colorful: 14<br>

1. How many socks of each color are there? If a sock has two different colors, it should be counted in both. However, if a sock has the same Color1 and Color2, make sure you don’t double count it!
1. Discuss your process of how you worked on this lab. Include details such as who you worked with, what methods you tried, what worked or didn’t work, what could have gone better, and what you learned during this lab. Focus more on the programming side of the lab! Feel free to attach images, screenshots, pseudocode, etc to elaborate on your response.
